Changes from version 0.6
========================

STDIN can now also be an input source if 
  1, filename '-' is used when doing simple filtering.
  2, filename '-' is stated as file with the 'zonefile' directive in
     the filter configuration file (-F).
  3, No zonefile is specified in the filter configuration file (-F).

-I switch fixed 



Changes from version 0.5
========================

A security problem existed as A-records in "forbidden" zones could be sneaked
in with MX/PTR/NS-records when specifiying ip as well.
Now these 'x'-fields are filtered equally as fqdn:s when specified along with
'ip'-fields, i.e. implicit A-record.

-x switch added to exit program with exitcode instead of 0. This enables 
shellscripts and Makefiles to determine if errors occured or not.

-q switch documented.

-v switch removed as it was not used.

hostname parts and fqdn:s now allowed to be stated in upper case.


Changes from version 0.4
========================
Tiny cosmetic fix


Changes from version 0.3
========================

Switch -r now just relaxes on 'root' records, i.e. fqdn == empty == root.

Switch -R now relaxes on 'mname', 'p' and 'rdata' being empty.
  Valid but with limited value.

Switch -i now relaxes on empty 'ip'-values. Does not generate any record.
  Really silly.

Totally empty records are also validated now. (i.e. max(tokens, mandatory))

:-records are now validated. Record type must not be 2 (NS), 5 (CNAME),
  6 (SOA), 12 (PTR), 15 (MX), or 252 (AXFR).

File include is now possible in filter files like this:

	deny    file:/etc/zones/localzones.txt
  
   or even

        zonefile  file:/etc/zones/zonefiles.txt

   (Note that inclusion of a file is initiated when a value starts with 'file:'
    and the part after this prefix is used as filename. This part is also
    used as a key to cache the content read, so multiple inclusions of the same
    file is not read from disk during a _single_ valtz-round. This is only 
    applicable when globbing with -F, 
    e.g. valtz -F /etc/zones/filters/zone-filter-external-* 
    and several of these files include the same file with file:... )

ipprefix is no longer mandatory in %lo-lines.

ignores excessive fields

Validates us of locations against previously defined %lo:s. Note that this
  requires lo:s to be declared before use. Really natural anyway.

Ignore files ending with ,v ~ .bak .log .old .swp .tmp
  (this ignoranze can be overridden by the switch -s)
